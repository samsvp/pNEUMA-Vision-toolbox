# pNUEMA-Vision-toolbox

This is the repository for utilizing pNEUMA Vision dataset. This repository is under construction and will be updated once the paper is published.

## Dataset Overview
- This dataset takes account of imagery part of [pNEUMA](https://open-traffic.epfl.ch/) dataset.
- Every 10th frame of the drone videos has been processed with following annotations:
    - **NEW Features (only in pNEUMA Vision)**
        - vehicle locations (x, y coordinates in image)
        - azimuths (clockwise, x-axis being 0&deg;)
        - Speed and azimuth anomaly tags
    - **Inherited Features (from pNUEMA)**
        - vehicle ID
        - vehicle type
        - timestamp
        - speed
        - acceleration

## Toolbox Overview
- This toolbox is a collection of functions that can be used to process pNEUMA Vision dataset.
- You can create two types of bounding boxes:
    - **Axis-aligned bounding box**
    ``` 
    Usage Example Here
    ```
    - **Rotated bounding box**
    ```
    Usage Example Here
